    Given EPAL1 pallet spec
    When I try to create a pallet unit with id "pu-1" cargo type GENERAL weight 5000 kg cargo height 100 mm
    Then it should fail with "exceeds"

  Scenario: Industrial spec rejects cargo weight exceeding 1500 kg limit
    Given Industrial pallet spec
    When I try to create a pallet unit with id "pu-1" cargo type GENERAL weight 2000 kg cargo height 100 mm
    Then it should fail with "exceeds"

  Scenario: CP1 spec rejects cargo weight exceeding 1190 kg limit

  # ── Obliczanie całkowitej wysokości ────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Total height equals pallet base plus cargo height
    Given EPAL1 pallet spec
    When I create a pallet unit with id "pu-1" cargo type GENERAL weight 500 kg cargo height 200 mm
    Then the pallet unit should be created successfully
    And total height should be 344 mm

  Scenario: Half pallet spec computes total height as base height plus cargo height
